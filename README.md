# Aal-Go

Aal-Go is a software solution designed for the analysis and visualization of acoustic telemetry data related to the migration patterns of European eels (Anguilla anguilla). This README provides an overview of the program, its features, and instructions for usage.

# Features

Data Import: Aal-Go allows users to import telemetry data from CSV files containing information about eel positions, timestamps, and other relevant data.

Data Analysis: The program provides tools for analyzing eel migration patterns, including graphical visualization of eel positions over time.

User-Friendly Interface: Aal-Go features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) designed to facilitate easy navigation and use by researchers and scientists.

Installation

Aal-Go is still in development and I have no installer or executable so far.

To run Aal-Go, follow these steps:
$ conda env create --name recoveredenv --file environment.yml
￼

1. Download the latest release from the GitHub repository.
2. Install anaconda3 23.7.4 with Python 3.11.5
3. Import the environment.yml as following: `$ conda env create --name recoveredenv --file environment.yml`
4. In a terminal navigate to the Aal-Go directory `cd path/to/your/directory`
5.  Run `python Aal-Go.py`

Once Aal-Go is running:

1. Use the "Datei öffnen" feature to load hydrophone data from CSV files into the program.
2. Explore the data using the various analysis and visualization tools available in the GUI.
